# Python and Python Environments 

## Diving Into Python

We'll start by going through [this notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1mrwoIPa1-tFYYjZP9TUNKMvIhovSeQ3L?usp=sharing) together. 
Collab notebook are an online Python notebook hosted by Google. 

## Installing Python Locally

There are a number of ways to install Python. 
You can directly install a Python distribution from the Python foundation. 
However, today we will instead be installing miniconda. 
Miniconda is based on Anaconda, a Python distribution which includes many popular scientific packages. 
However, it also takes up a lot of file space. 
Miniconda is a small, bootstrap version of Anaconda that includes only conda, Python, the packages they depend on, and a small number of other useful packages, including pip, zlib and a few others.
[You can download and install miniconda here](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).

## Installing an IDE 

We're going to use PyCharm as our developement environment for Python. You're welcome to use another (Visual Studio Cody, Spyder, Emacs, Vim, etc.) but we will be mainly supporting PyCharm. 
Make sure to select the **Community Version**. 
You can [download Pycharm here](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download).
